# Lab

* Setup a React Project
  * Copy over the data file from pokedex
  * Render all Pokemon by displaying their name & image onto the page
  * Make it so that on clicking an image, you can see all available images from the pokedex
  * If we click on a different image, it changes that pokemon's image

Make sure to have a component architecture in mind! (Draw it out!)

Stretch Goal:
* Make an close button to cancel the selector when you click on a pokemon
* Make the selector close when you clicked a new pokemon image
